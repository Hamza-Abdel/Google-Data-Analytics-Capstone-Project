## Total rides

![Total Rides](https://github.com/Hamza-Abdel/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project/assets/87425827/c43dda31-b66d-4a43-b61d-0005cd3a93f5)

* Annual members made up ~ **2/3** of total rides.
* while Casual riders made up a ~ **1/3** of total rides.
* which means that Members take **_twice as many rides_** as Casual riders on average.

## Average ride duration (in minutes) for each type of rider

* Members take on average **12** minutes per ride.
* Casuals take on average **23** minutes per ride.
* Although Casuals take less total rides, the duration of the trips they take is almost **_twice as long_** compared to Members.
* One possible interpretation is that frequency of rides is what influences someone to become a Member. While people who take longer, less frequent trips choose Casual rides.

## Activity per month and seasonality

* The most activity happens during the **summer** months followed by **autumn**.

* Summer makes up 39% of total annual rides.

* Perhaps this increase in summer could be explained by **_summer vacation_**. Which could indicate that a significant number of users ride recreationally, rather than as a mode of transportation. However further data is needed to confirm this.

## Total rides by weekday

* The most popular day for Members is **Wednesday**.
* We could also observe that the days with the most activity for Members is in workdays. while the activity drops on the weekend, with **Sunday** being the day with the least activity.
* The most popular day for Casuals is **Saturday** followed by **Sunday**.
* Casual riders are more active in the weekend, compared to the weekend.
* This could mean that Members use the bikes to commute to work, while Casuals use it recreationally (Further data is needed to confirm this).
* In total the most popular day is **Saturday**, and also the activity is roughly stable throughout the week.

## Total Activity through out the day

* The activity pattern for Members and Casuals is very similar. (it might seem different because of the y-axis are large in value in relation to total casual rides).

* The activity begins to rise at **4:00 AM** and peaks at **8:00 AM**.
* The activity then stagnates unti it starts rising again at **2:00 PM** and peaks at **5:00 PM**.
* This activity pattern reflects daily commute times to work and school.

* The most popular ride type are classic bikes.
* The least popular ride type are docked bikes. Annual members never choose docked bikes.

# Conclusion

The analysis of ride-sharing data reveals distinct patterns in user behavior and preferences. Annual members, constituting approximately two-thirds of total rides, demonstrate a consistent use of the service, predominantly for shorter, more frequent trips averaging 12 minutes. This suggests that the regularity of rides is a key factor in the decision to opt for membership. In contrast, casual riders account for about one-third of rides, with each journey averaging 23 minutesâ€”nearly double the duration of member rides. Despite their lower overall ride count, the extended length of casual rides implies a preference for less frequent but longer trips, possibly for leisure purposes.

Seasonal trends indicate a surge in activity during the summer months, accounting for 39% of annual rides, followed by autumn. This peak could be attributed to recreational riding during the summer vacation period, although additional data would be required to substantiate this hypothesis. Weekly patterns further underscore the divergent usage between members and casual riders; members are most active on Wednesdays and generally during workdays, with a noticeable dip over the weekends. Conversely, casual riders show a preference for weekends, particularly Saturdays and Sundays, reinforcing the notion that casual rides are predominantly recreational.

The daily activity pattern, with spikes at 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM, aligns with typical commuting hours, suggesting that many users may be utilizing the service for transportation to and from work or school. Afternoons emerge as the peak time for ride-sharing activity. When it comes to ride types, classic bikes are the favored choice, while docked bikes are the least popular, with annual members avoiding them entirely.


## comment

I tried to annalyze the most popular start and end stations but the results didn't show any significant patterns.
