![Total Rides](https://github.com/Hamza-Abdel/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project/assets/87425827/c43dda31-b66d-4a43-b61d-0005cd3a93f5)

* Annual members made up ~ **2/3** of total rides.
* while Casual riders made up a ~ **1/3** of total rides.
* which means that Members take **_twice as many rides_** as Casual riders on average.

# Average ride duration (in minutes) for each type of rider

![Avg Trip](https://github.com/Hamza-Abdel/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project/assets/87425827/5b996691-8f40-4d84-b388-1934b6d41c45)

* Members take on average **12** minutes per ride.
* Casuals take on average **23** minutes per ride.
* Although Casuals take less total rides, the duration of the trips they take is almost **_twice as long_** compared to Members.
* One possible interpretation is that frequency of rides is what influences someone to become a Member. While people who take longer, less frequent trips choose Casual rides.

# Activity per month and seasonality

* The most activity happens during the **summer** months followed by **autumn**.

* Perhaps this increase in summer could be explaind by **_summer vacation_**. Which could indicate that a significant number of users ride recreationally, rather than as a mode of transportation. However further data is needed to confirm this.

# Total rides by weekday

* The most popular day for Members is **Wednesday**.
* We could also observe that the days with the most activity for Members is in workdays. while the activity drops on the weekend, with **Sunday** being the day with the least activity.
* The most popular day for Casuals is **Saturday** followed by **Sunday**.
* Casual riders are more active in the weekend, compared to the weekend.
* This could mean that Members use the bikes to commute to work, while Casuals use it recreationally (Further data is needed to confirm this).
* In total the most popular day is **Saturday**, and also the activity is roughly stable throughout the week.

# Total Activity through out the day

* The activity pattern for Members and Casuals is very similar. (it might seem different because of the y-axis are large in value in relation to total casual rides).

* The activity begins to rise at **4:00 AM** and peaks at **8:00 AM**.
* The activity then stagnates unti it starts rising again at **2:00 PM** and peaks at **5:00 PM**.
* This activity pattern reflects daily commute times to work and school.
